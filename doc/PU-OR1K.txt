# PU-OR1K WIKI

A Processing Unit (PU) is an electronic system within a computer that carries out instructions of a program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specified by instructions. Instruction-level parallelism is a measure of how many instructions in a computer can be executed simultaneously. The PU is contained on a Single Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Integrated Circuit (IC).
